Problem Statement

Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering, and it is mainly concerned with the technology of electricity. As such Electrical engineers work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge power station generators. It requires a major expertise in the analysis of electrical networks. One of main applications of their problem solving skills is to carry out circuit analysis. These circuits may include resistors, capacitors and inductors.

The purpose of this assignment is to develop a C++ programme for a simple Electrical Networks problem solver. It should be able to perform the following calculations:
1.	Total resistance, current and power for a direct current (DC) circuit
2.	Time constant for a series/parallel DC RC (Resistance Capacitance) network
3.	Terminal voltage in a series/parallel DC RC network
4.	Time constant for a series/parallel DC RL (Resistance Inductance) network
5.	Terminal voltage in a series/parallel DC RL network
6.	Total impedance, current and power for a alternating current (AC) circuit
